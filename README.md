# MY-APPLICATION
Malaria Tracking System (MTS) is a monitoring system which major focus is to capture and monitor patients infected with malaria
The â€˜Malaria Tracking System was developed using python programming language as its front-end which is an object-oriented programming language while PhpMysql Database in Wamp server was used to develop the back-end where information is stored.
Matplotlib in Python was used to draw the graph that shows the rate of increase or decrease of malaria in the system.
The alert system used in the application was designed using window sound in windows and play sound module in python. A warning show message dialogue box which triggers when there is an increase rate of malaria was incorporated. While loop was use to set the condition.

PyCharm (IDE) was used as the development environment for the project. The front-end interface was linked with the back-end interface for smooth operation.
